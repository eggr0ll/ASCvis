# ASCvis
Initially, I am going to make 2 maps:
- One that displays a county's attendance out of the total ASC attendance (as a percent).
- One that displays a county's attendance out of the same county's populations (as a percent).

Later, data from the other ASC locations will be included.

For the county coordinates & other info, I used the `.json` file from plotly's choropleth article.
